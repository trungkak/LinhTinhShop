Deckled foredge (see final image). xii+462p.  8vo. 8º (octavo). Review of Eliot's <em>Collected Poems</em> from a 1963 issue of the <em>Saturday Review</em> laid in.</span></p>
                <p><span> "The past half~century has been Eliot's age in that Thomas Stearns Eliot, a shy colossus, bestrode the period as Virgil or Dante or Dryden or Johnson had dominated very different times. "T. S. Eliot was the principal champion of the moral imagination in the twentieth century . It is conceivable that in some distant future time, when the history of the twentieth century seems barbarous and bewildering as the chronicles of Scotland's medieval age, the piercing visions of Eliot may be regarded as the purest light which endured in that general darkness." These lines from the first chapter of Eliot and His Age capture the spirit of this masterful book, which' is the first full~length study of Eliot as the "greatest man of letters in his time." The book draws upon Eliot's experience as well as upon his poetry and prose, tracing the links between his life and his writings for the whole of his career. It contains, in addition to a unique examination of his works, selections from correspondence and conversations which the author had with Mr. Eliot during his lifetime. Russell Kirk was a friend of Eliot's later years, and he brings to the poet's life a special understanding, born both of their common political beliefs and of their genuine liking for each other. To Eliot's many admirers, the new insights into this austere artist's life will be enormously valuable. Kirk views the turning in Eliot's work, from the despair of youth to "affirming the enduring order of things" in his old age, as a parable for twentieth century man. He interprets what Eliot is saying to mean that this is the time to rise out of the despair of existential philosophy and to find in traditional values, in religious belief, in personal integrity, "order of the soul and order of the Commonwealth.".</span></p>
